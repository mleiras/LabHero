# Mission 01: Into the Microbial World

Welcome, Lab Hero! Your journey begins with Mission 01: Into the Microbial World.

In this mission, you will step into the fascinating world of E. coli, a microscopic organism with incredible metabolic abilities.

Your goal is to simulate and observe E. coli's behavior under anaerobic conditions.

Anaerobic means 'without oxygen', and it's time to uncover the secrets of how E. coli thrives in these challenging environments.

## Dialogue with Dr. Martinez

**Dr. Martinez:** "Hello! I'm Dr. Martinez, and I'm working on groundbreaking research involving E. coli.
We're trying to understand how this remarkable microbe adapts to different environments, especially anaerobic ones. Can you help me?


*After activating the mission:*

**Dr. Martinez:** "Did you already made a simulation? Can you show me your results?"


*After completing the mission:*

**Dr. Martinez:** "Thank you! You're pioneering our understanding of E. coli's resilience. Your discoveries will shape our research."


## Mission Briefing

For this initial mission, we have chosen Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) as the simulation method for several important reasons:

- **Fundamental Understanding**: FBA provides a foundational understanding of how metabolic networks function. It's an excellent starting point for exploring the intricacies of E. coli's metabolism.
- **Anaerobic Adaptations**: FBA allows you to analyze E. coli's metabolic reactions and predict how they adapt to anaerobic conditions. This is crucial as anaerobic environments often require different metabolic strategies.

- **Steady-State Analysis**: FBA focuses on achieving a metabolic steady state, which is essential for understanding how E. coli balances its reactions to grow and thrive under specific conditions.

- **Comparative Analysis**: FBA enables you to compare anaerobic simulations with later missions involving other methods like pFBA, lMOMA, and ROOM. This comparison will highlight the advantages and limitations of each method.


### Hints:

- Ensure the absence of oxygen in your simulation.
