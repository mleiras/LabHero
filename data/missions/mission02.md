# Mission 02: Genetic Mystery - The Essential Gene

Welcome back, budding scientist! Your journey through the microbial world continues.

In this mission, you'll unravel the secrets of a crucial gene that's vital for E. coli's survival.

Get ready for the Genetic Mystery - The Essential Gene challenge!


## Dialogue with Dr. Silva

**Dr. Silva:** Greetings, intrepid explorer of the microbial world! I'm Dr. Silva!
We've compiled a list of ten genes within E. coli, and we suspect that one of them is essential for its survival. Can you find each one is the essential one to E. coli's?"


*After activating the mission:*

**Dr. Silva:** "Did you already find the essential gene? Can you show me your results?"


*After completing the mission:*

**Dr. Silva:** ""Thank you! Your research will unlock a hidden chapter in E. coli's genetic story. Your discoveries may have far-reaching implications in our understanding of microbial life."


## Mission Briefing


### Objective:

Your primary objective in this mission is to identify the essential gene that E. coli cannot live without.

Imagine you're solving a microbial puzzle where one missing piece makes all the difference.

List of possible genes that are essential:
- b1241
- b3115
- b3736
- b2975
- b1524
- b2278
- b2926
- b2297
- b0728
- b3919


### Tasks:

**Task 1 - The Mystery Genes:**

You'll start with a list of 10 mystery genes, each associated with a specific cellular function. These genes are like keys to E. coli's survival.

**Task 2 - Gene Knockout Simulations:**

Your job is to simulate E. coli's growth without each of these genes, one by one. This process mimics what scientists do in the lab when they "knock out" a gene to observe the consequences.
            
**Task 3 - Observe and Compare:**

As you simulate E. coli's growth without each gene, carefully observe the results. Does the absence of a particular gene affect growth? Do some genes appear more critical than others?
            
**Task 4 - Unravel the Mystery:**

Analyze your observations and deductions. Which gene do you suspect is the essential one? Remember, the essential gene is the one that, when missing, significantly impairs E. coli's growth.
            
**Task 5 - Report Your Findings:**

Compile your findings into a comprehensive report. Explain why you suspect a particular gene is essential and provide evidence from your simulations to support your conclusion.


### Hints:

- Ensure that you simulate with only one gene at a time
- Identify the gene that stops growth
