# LabHero

A serious game that empowers non-bioinformaticians to learn how to use genome-scale metabolic models.

The game consists of simulating distinct environmental and genetic modifications of towards specific objectives. At each game level, the player is required to define a strategy that encompasses selecting a medium and/or choosing genetic modifications to achieve a certain result.

## Introduction

This game was developed as a part of the master's thesis of Mónica Leiras "Development of a serious game to stimulate the learning of genome-scale metabolic modeling concepts" (MSc in Bioinformatics - University of Minho).


## Game Story 

You’re a bioinformatician working at the University. You have a desk in the office of the Bioinformatics Department, where you can chat and socialize with your fellow bioinformaticians about the various projects they work on.

Your job is to help fellow researchers with the various problems they encounter during their projects. In the labs, you’ll find various missions in the field of systems biology and metabolic modeling. To complete these missions you’ll need to talk to the researchers and understand the challenges they face.

You will quickly find yourself having to carry out simulations with different environmental and genetic conditions, as suggested by the researchers, in order to obtain results more quickly. 

You can also study and learn more about systems biology and metabolic modeling with books you’ll find in your office library to help you complete the missions.

Welcome to LabHero!


## Controls

**Moving:**

Use arrows (up, down, left, righ) or WASD keys to move the character.

**Interacting:**

Use ENTER key to open the dialogue when close to another character (scientists).

Use ENTER key to open the simulation window when close to your desk.

Use ENTER key to consult books when close to the library.

Use ENTER key to take an apple from a tree ("An apple a day keeps the doctor away").

**Buttons:**

Use the Mouse to click on the buttons of the dialogues.

**Main Menu:**
