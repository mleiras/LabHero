abstract: "UG is a generic framework to parallelize branch-and-bound based solvers (e.g., MIP, MINLP, ExactIP) in a distributed or shared memory computing environment. It exploits powerful performance of state-of-the-art base solvers, such as SCIP, CPLEX, etc. without the need for base solver parallelization"
