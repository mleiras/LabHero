Notes for UG Release 0.8.6

Note that this version is still beta.

Features
========
- C++11 threads can be used for communication. 
- Customized racing ramp-up is supported.
- For ug[SCIP,*], branching on constraints is supported.
- For ug[SCIP,*], interfaces for user to initialize subproblems are added.
- UGS interface is included in UG solver.
- ug[SCIP-Jack,*] and UG[SCIP-SDP,*] can be used with customized parameter sets in racing.
- ug[SCIP-Jack, MPI] communicates information about branching decisions to all processes
  and the underlying graphs are changed accordingly (which expecially improves cutting planes and propagation).
