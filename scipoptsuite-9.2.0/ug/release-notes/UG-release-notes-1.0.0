Notes for UG Release 1.0.0

- generalization of UG, in which all solvers developed so far can be handled by a single unified framework.
  UG version 1.0 is completely different from the previous versions internally, though its interfaces for branch-and-bound base solvers remain the same as far as possible.
  The original UG base classes are separated into branch-and-bound related codes and the others, so that non-branch-and-bound solvers can be parallelized naturally.
  The classes ParaSolver, ParaComm, ParaLoadCoordinator, ParaParamSet are abstracted.
- Start of doxygen documentation
- CMake build system for fiberscip and parascip
- Join ParaSolver Threads of FiberSCIP and terminate cleanly when one thread finds solution.
- Time Limit Feature Implementation of FiberSCIP
- Introduction of SelfSplit Ramp-up feature to FiberSCIP and ParaSCIP.
- Memory usage estimation; The FiberSCIP memory usage estimation feature is implemented by using SCIP functions.  Termination with "memory limit reached" on reaching system memory limit.
