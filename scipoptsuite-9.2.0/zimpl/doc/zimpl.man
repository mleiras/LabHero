.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Zimpl
is a little language to translate the mathematical model of a problem
into a linear or (mixed-)integer mathematical program expressed in LPF
or MPS file format which can be read by a LP or MIP solver.

None of the options is necessary. All input files in 
.B zpl
format that are given are concatenated and processed as if they are
one big file. This makes is possible to combine different parts of a
model on the command line. In this case the first filename given will
be used as basename for the output files in absence of an 
.B \-o
option.

The 
.B \-t
option is to select the output format. 
.B mps 
can be read by every
solver. 
.B lpf 
is a CPLEX format, but can also read by several solvers.
BE aware that for example Range-rows can not be expressed in 
.B lpf . 
If you would like to inspected the output yourself, 
.B hum
format is a variant of 
.B lpf
with no name mangeling whatever, but unfortunately this violates
several format restrictions, so no solver will read this in.
If
.B rlp
is specified the output is in 
.B lpf 
format, but rows and columns are randomly permuted.
 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-b
Enable 
.BR bison (1)
debugging output.
.IP "\-D name=value"
Sets the parameter
.I name
to the specified value. This is equivalent with having this line in the
Zimpl program: param name:=val .
.IP -f
Enable
.BR flex (1)
debugging output.
.IP "\-F filter"
The output is piped through a filter. A %s in the
string is replaced by the output filename. For example: 
-F "gzip \-c >%s.gz" would compress all the 
output files.
.IP -h
Show program help.
.IP "\-l length"
Sets the maximum length for variable names in LPF output files.
.IP -m
Write a CPLEX .mst Mip STart file.
.IP "\-n cm|cn|cf"
Select the format for the generation of constraint
names. Can be either 
.I cm 
which will number them 
1 ... n with a `c' in front. 
.I cn 
will use the name supplied in the subto statement and 
number them 1 ... n within the statement. 
.I cf 
will use the name given with the subto,
then a 1 .. n number like in 
.I cm 
and then append all the local variables from the forall statements.
.IP "-o outfile"
Sets the base-name for the output files. Default is the name of the
input file without extension.
.IP \-O 
Optimize the generated LP by doing some presolve analysis (experimental).
.IP "\-P filter" 
The input is piped through a filter. A %s in the
string is replaced by the input filename. For example: 
\-F "cpp -DWITH_C1 %s" would pass the input file through the
C-preprocessor.
.IP \-r 
Write a CPLEX .ord branching order file.
.IP "\-s seed"
Set the random number generator seed.
.IP "\-t lp|mps|hum|rlp|pip"
Selects the output format. Can be either 
.I lp
which is default, or 
.I mps 
, or
.I hum 
, which is (only) human readable, or 
.I rlp
, which is randomly permuted, or
.I pip
, which means polynimial IP.
.IP "\-v 0-5"
Set the verbosity level. 0 is quiet, 1 is default,
2 is verbose, 3 is chatter, and 5 is debug.
.IP \-V
Prints the version number.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:

101 Bad filename
.RS
The name given with the 
.B \-o option 
is either missing, a directory name, or starts with a dot.
.RE
175 Illegal syntax for command line define -- ignored
.RS
The parameter of a 
.B \-D 
option was either not of the form 
.I "name=value"
or the name was not a legal identifier.
.RE
There are about a hundred other possible error messages, but these are
either about the contend of the input file, or system messages.
.SH BUGS
Please report any bug to the author.
