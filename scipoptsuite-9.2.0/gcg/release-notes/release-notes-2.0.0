Notes for GCG Release 2.0.0

General
================
We are proud to release GCG in version 2.0.0. The major version number
increase from 1.1.1 is justified, as we include major new features. Check
both the feature list as well as the CHANGELOG for the changes

Features
================

 * parallelization of the pricing process: compile GCG with OPENMP=true and
   benefit from concurrently solving the pricing problems (you need to compile
   SCIP with PARASCIP=true) greatly reducing the time to solve difficult
   problems to optimality.

 * Generic branching: We can branch on arbitrary, bounded instances with
   discretization with and without aggregation. That enables us to solve
   cutting stock type instances much faster.

 * New detectors: We can now detect staircase structures as well as identical
   pricing problems that can be aggregated, thus removing some of the
   symmetry. Check out the staircase and isomorph detectors!

 * New heuristics: We can find even better solutions using a variety of diving
   and other heuristics in both the master and original space. See if we can
   find good solutions to your problem.
