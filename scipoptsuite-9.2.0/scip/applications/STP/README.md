STP - SCIP-Jack
===============

SCIP-Jack is a solver for the classic Steiner tree problem in graphs, and fourteen related problems,
such as the prize-collecting Steiner tree problem, or the maximum-weight connected subgraph problem.
SCIP-Jack is currently the fastest solver for almost all of these fifteen problem classes, including
the Steiner tree problem in graphs, the prize-collecting Steiner tree problem, and the maximum-weight
connected subgraph problem. It can typically compute minimum Steiner trees even for large-scale graphs
with several hundred thousand edges within minutes.
