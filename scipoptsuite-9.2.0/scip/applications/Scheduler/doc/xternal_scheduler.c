 *
 * This example contains several readers and @subpage LISTHEUR "one primal heuristic" for scheduling
 * problems. Via this example three different type of scheduling problem can be parsed and solved with \SCIP. These are:
 *
 *  - resource-constrained project scheduling problems (RCPSP) (see reader_sm.h)
 *  - resource-constrained project scheduling problem with minimal and maximal time lags (RCPSP/max) (see reader_sch.h)
 *  - pack instances (see reader_rcp.h)
 *
 * Installation
 * ------------

 * See the @ref INSTALL_APPLICATIONS_EXAMPLES "Install file"
