/**@file   pricer_coloring.h
 * @brief  variable pricer for the vertex coloring problem
 * @author Gerald Gamrath
 *
 * This file implements the pricer for the coloring algorithm.
 *
 * It computes maximal stable sets in the current graph whose corresponding variables can improve
 * the current LP solution.  This is done by computing a maximum weighted stable set in the current
 * graph with dual-variables of the node constraints as weights. A variable can improve the
 * solution, if the weight of the corresponding stable set is larger than 1, since it then has
 * negative reduced costs, which are given by (1 - weight of the set).
 *
 * The pricer first tries to compute such a stable set using a a greedy-method. If it fails, the tclique-algorithm is
 * used on the complementary graph. This is a branch-and-bound based algorithm for maximal cliques,
 * included in SCIP.  In this case, not only the best solution is added to the LP, but also all other
 * stable sets found during the branch-and-bound process that could improve the current LP solution
 * are added, limited to a maximal number that can be changed by a parameter.
