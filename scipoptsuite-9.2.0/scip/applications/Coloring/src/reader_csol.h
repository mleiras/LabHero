/**@file   reader_csol.h
 * @brief  file reader and writer for vertex coloring solutions
 * @author Gerald Gamrath
 *
 * This file implements the reader and writer for coloring solution files.
 *
 * These files have the following structure:@n The first line contains the name of the problem, the
 * number of colors used in the solution, and - optional - the name of the algorithm that computed
 * this solution.  The second line lists the colors of the nodes, separated by spaces. It is sorted
 * increasingly by the node indices. The numbers for the colors start with 0.
