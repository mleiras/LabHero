/**@page MIPSOLVER_MAIN SCIP as a MIP solver
 * @version  0.1
 * @author   Tobias Achterberg
 *
 * This very basic example illustrates how to integrate SCIP into your C++ source code.  The SCIP header files are
 * included from the directory which is denoted by SCIPDIR in the Makefile. If your SCIP headers are installed somewhere
 * else, just change this link. Since this example is written in C++, objscip/objscip.h is included at the beginning of
 * cppmain.cpp. It includes scip.h (which you would include when using SCIP as callable library in a C
 * program). The main function shows how the SCIP_RETCODE can be caught and handled. In runSCIP(), you see how a SCIP
 * instance is created and freed, plus a few more things. Here, the SCIP_RETCODEs are not checked explicitly but handled
 * by the SCIP_CALL macro. Please also note the CallableLibrary example for nonlinear problems.
 *
 * Installation
 * ------------

 * See the @ref INSTALL_APPLICATIONS_EXAMPLES "Install file"
