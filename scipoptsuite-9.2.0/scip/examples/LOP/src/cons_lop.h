/**@file   cons_lop.h
 * @brief  constraint handler for linear ordering constraints
 * @author Marc Pfetsch
 *
 * This constraint ensures that a given square matrix of binary variables corresponds to a
 * tournament, i.e., it is an acyclic orientation of the complete graph. This encodes a linear order
 * as follows. The rows and columns correspond to the elements of the set to be ordered. A variable
 * x[i][j] is 1 if and only if element i appears before j in the order.
 *
 * In this constraint handler we only add the symmetry equations and separate the triangle
 * inequalities yielding a correct IP model.
 *
 * The variables on the diagonal are ignored.
