 * @brief  Gomory cut branching rule
 * @author Mark Turner
 *
 * The approach is based on the following papers.
 *
 * M. Turner, T. Berthold, M. Besancon, T. Koch@n
 * Branching via Cutting Plane Selection: Improving Hybrid Branching,@n
 * arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.06050
 *
 * The Gomory cut branching rule selects a candidate integer variable $j$ with a fractional solution value.
 * Each candidate variable must be a basic variable in the LP Tableau (if not then it would have to be at its bound
 * that is integer-valued)
 * This branching rule calculates the GMI cut for the aggregated row of the LP tableau associated with the
 * candidate variable.
 * The generated cut is then scored using a weighted sum rule.
 * The branching candidate whose cut is highest scoring is then selected.
 * For more details on the method, see:
