# SCIP: Solving Constraint Integer Programs

Welcome to what is currently one of the fastest academically developed solvers
for mixed integer programming (MIP) and mixed integer nonlinear programming
(MINLP). In addition, SCIP provides a highly flexible framework for constraint
integer programming and branch-cut-and-price. It allows for total control of the
solution process and the access of detailed information down to the guts of the
solver.
